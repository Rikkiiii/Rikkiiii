## 👋 Hi, I'm Yuxin Lang

## ✨ Personal Statement

I’m currently a graduated Master's student in **Analytics** at *Auckland University of Technology*, with strong interests in **data-driven risk assessment**, **forecasting models**, and **statistical decision-making**.

I began my career with a Bachelor of Science degree at **North China University of Technology**, where I developed core skills in **mathematics**, **programming**, and **statistical analysis**. Now, I graduated from Auckland University of Technology with a Master of Science in Analytics, and worked on projects that combined academic rigor with practical impact. Notably, I worked as a **research assistant**, building time series forecasting models such as **random forests**, **long short-term memory (LSTM)**, and **N-BEATS** to predict electricity price fluctuations, a job that involved model tuning, performance visualization, and sensitivity analysis.

During my internship at China Science Software Co., Ltd., I analyzed more than 3 million population mobility data to support epidemic risk tracking and used Python to automate some processes to improve efficiency. Previously, during my internship at the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Statistics, I assisted in the national census and contributed to improving data accuracy and record quality.

These experiences have shaped my **analytical thinking**, **attention to detail**, and **communication skills**. Whether I’m building machine learning pipelines or assisting students as a **teaching assistant**, I enjoy connecting data with people—and I’m excited about future positions that allow me to do both.
